# CreditRisk

## Overview of Project
I am to apply machine learning to help solve credit card risk. Jill asks me to use imblanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling.

### Purpose
The purpose is to help credit card risk. I am to evaluate the performance of these models and make a written recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.

- [x] Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
- [x] Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
- [x] Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
- [x] Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)
